# BRCA-ML
Prediction of the functional impact of missense variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 with BRCA-ML


[These instructions](BRCA_ML.Rmd) allow you to see how we derived the BRCA-ML scores for BRCA1 and BRCA2. For simplicity, they are written in the [RMarkdown syntax](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). Unfortunately, GitHub does not natively render RMarkdown documents, so its best to visualize with [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/). If you aren't familiar with Rstudio, just know that it is totally free and makes it suer simple to walk through R code the same way you would with [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for Python.


To rederive new scores, you can change the parameters of the model (see lines 366-429).
